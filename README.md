# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Alpha-Beta Pruning)

This project is a classic **Tic Tac Toe** game where the user plays against an **unbeatable AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**. The game features a clean graphical interface built using **Pygame**, and the AI is designed to **never lose** ‚Äî it will either win or force a draw every time.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Unbeatable AI**: Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to always make the optimal move.
- üéÆ **Pygame UI**: Interactive and responsive graphical interface using Pygame.
- ‚ö° **Efficient Algorithm**: Alpha-Beta pruning speeds up the decision-making process.
- ü§ù **Player vs AI**: You play as X, and the AI plays as O.

## Project Structure

```
/project-root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tictactoe.py        # Game logic and AI implementation using alpha-beta pruning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runner.py           # Pygame UI and main game loop
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # List of required Python packages
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-alpha-beta.git
cd tic-tac-toe-alpha-beta
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** and **Pygame** installed.

4. To install Pygame manually (if it's not in `requirements.txt`):
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

Run the game using:
```bash
python runner.py
```

- You play as **X or O**.
- **X** always starts first.
- The AI is **unbeatable** ‚Äî it will never lose. It will either **win** or **draw**, depending on your moves.

## How the AI Works

The AI is powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, a classic technique used in game theory:

- **Minimax** explores all possible moves to find the best one.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** eliminates unnecessary branches in the decision tree, improving performance.

This makes the AI:

- Always play optimally.
- Never make a mistake.
- Unbeatable ‚Äî perfect for testing your skills.
